## Abstract 
Perfectly informationally efficient markets cannot exist if information is costly.
If prices fully reflect all information, traders have no incentive to pay to become informed, since they cannot earn profits from that information. As a result, fewer agents would gather information, and prices would stop being fully informative. Therefore, market prices must remain partially informative: some inefficiency is necessary to maintain incentives to acquire information.

## Important Results/Ideas
Conjecture 1: The more individuals who are informed, the more informative is the price system.

Conjecture 2: The more individuals who are informed, the lower the ratio of expected utility of the informed to the uninformed. The  equilibrium number of informed and uninformed individuals in the economy will depend on a number of critical parameters: the cost of  information, how informative the price system is, and how informative the information obtained by an informed individual is. 

Conjecture 3: The higher the cost of information, the smaller will be the equilibrium percentage of individuals who are informed. 

Conjecture 4: If the quality of the informed trader's information increases, the more their demands will vary with their information  and thus the more prices will vary with 9. Hence, the price system becomes more informative. The equilibrium proportion of informed  to uninformed  may be either increased or decreased, because even though the value of being informed has increased due to the increased  quality of 9, the value of being uninformed has also increased because the price system becomes more informative. 

Conjecture 5: The greater the magnitude of noise, the less informative will the price system be, and hence the lower the expected utility of uninformed individuals. Hence, in equilibrium the greater the magnitude of noise, the larger the proportion of informed  individuals. 

Conjecture 6: In the limit, when there is no noise, prices convey all information, and there is no incentive to purchase information.  Hence, the only possible equilibrium is one with no information. But if everyone is uninformed, it clearly pays some individual to become informed. Thus, there does not exist a competitive equilibrium. Trade among individuals occurs either because tastes (risk aversions) differ, endowments differ, or beliefs differ. This paper focuses on the last of these three. An interesting feature of the equilibrium is that beliefs may be precisely identical in either one of two situations: when all individuals are informed or when all individuals are uninformed. This gives rise to: 

Conjecture 7: That, other things being equal, markets will be thinner under those conditions in which the percentage of individuals who are informed (X) is either near zero or near unity. For example, markets will be thin when there is very little noise in the system (so X is near zero), or when costs of information are very low (so X is near unity)."
