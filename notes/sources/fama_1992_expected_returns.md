## Conclusion

The Sharpe-Lintner-Black (SLB) model has long shaped the way academics and practitioners think about average return and risk. Studies by Black, Jensen, Scholes (1972), and Fama and MacBeth (1973) initially demonstrated a positive correlation between average return and market risk (beta) in the early years of data (1926-1968). However, this relationship dissipated during the period from 1963 to 1990. Additionally, the weak connection between average return and market beta persisted in the years from 1941 to 1990.

Research indicates that other factors such as firm size, leverage, and book-to-market equity play significant roles in explaining expected returns. Specifically, studies show that firm size and book-to-market equity encapsulate the variations in returns previously linked to multiple other factors, leading to the conclusion that these two factors capture significant cross-sectional variations in stock returns from 1963 to 1990. Although these factors could be irrational (happens by chance in this sample), if they're not then they have practical implications for portfolio management and evaluation. Size and book-to-market metrics serve as risk proxies, thus enabling comparisons of managed portfolio performance against benchmark portfolios with similar characteristics.
