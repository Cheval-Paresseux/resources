## Conclusion
The theory of efficient markets is concerned with whether prices at any point in time "fully reflect" available information. The theory only has empirical content, however, within the context of a more specific model of market equilibrium. We have seen that all of the available empirical literature is implicitly or explicitly based on the assumption that the conditions of market equilibrium can be stated in terms of expected returns. This assumption is the basis of the expected return or "fair game" efficient markets models. 
**Strong-form** tests are concerned with whether individual investors or groups have monopolistic access to any information relevant for price formation. In the less restrictive **semi-strong-form** tests the information subset of interest includes all obviously publicly available information, while in the **weak form** tests the information subset is just historical price or return sequences.

***Weak form tests of the efficient market model are the most voluminous, and it seems fair to say that the results are strongly in support.*** Though statistically significant evidence for dependence in successive price changes or returns has been found, some of this is consistent with the "fair game" model and the rest does not appear to be sufficient to declare the market inefficient. Indeed, at least ***for price changes or returns covering a day or longer, there isn't much evidence against the "fair game" model's more ambitious offspring, the random walk.***

## Key Definitions

**Efficient Market**: The primary role of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the economy's capital stock. In general terms, the ideal is a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation: that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and investors can choose among the securities that represent ownership of firms' activities under the assumption that security prices at any time "fully reflect" all available information. A market in which prices always "fully reflect" available information is called "efficient". 

**Three Forms of Market Efficiency**:
1. **Weak Form**: Information subset includes only historical prices
2. **Semi-Strong Form**: Information subset includes all obviously publicly available information
3. **Strong Form**: Information subset includes all information relevant for price formation, including monopolistic information

**Fair Game / Expected Return Models**: Most of the available work is based only on the assumption that the conditions of market equilibrium can (somehow) be stated in terms of expected returns. In general terms, like the two parameter model (Sharpe) such theories would posit that conditional on some relevant information set, the equilibrium expected return on a security is a function of its "risk". And differetn theories would differ primarily in how "risk" is defined. 
1. All members of the class of such "expected return theories" can, however, be described notationally as : E(p̃ⱼ,ₜ₊₁|Φₜ) = [1 + E(r̃ⱼ,ₜ₊₁|Φₜ)]pⱼₜ . 
2. Submartingale model : special case where E(p̃ⱼ,ₜ₊₁|Φₜ) ≥ pⱼₜ (expected returns are non-negative). It implies that trading systems based only on information in Φₜ cannot have expected profits in excess of equilibrium expected returns (if you short the security then, by definition, you have negative expected return).
3. Random walk model : successive price changes are independent and identically distributed : f(r̃ⱼ,ₜ₊₁|Φₜ) = f(r̃ⱼ,ₜ₊₁) . The conditional and marginal probability distributions of an independent random variable are identical. In addition, the density function f must be the same for all t.
