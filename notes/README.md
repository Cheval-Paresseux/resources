# Notes

This directory contains **all notes written by me**.

## Structure

- `concepts/`  
  Core ideas, models, definitions, and abstractions  
  (e.g. order books, market microstructure, latency)

- `sources/`  
  Notes *about* individual sources (papers, articles, reports)  
  One Markdown file per source, linked to the raw PDF

- `ideas/`  
  Research questions, hypotheses, experiment ideas, open problems

- `index.md`  
  Entry point and navigation hub for all notes (Nvim)

---

## Rules

- Only files I write belong here
- No PDFs or external documents
- Notes may link to:
  - other notes
  - raw sources
  - bibliography keys (`@firstauthorYYYYtitle` in lowercase only)

These notes are meant to be reused directly when writing the thesis.
