# Raw Sources

This directory contains **original source materials** that I did not write.
Files here are treated as **read-only**.

## Structure

- `academic/`  
  Peer-reviewed papers, preprints, working papers (PDF)

- `press/`  
  News articles, blog posts, opinion pieces

- `utils/`  
  Standards, specifications, documentation, datasets, misc references

## Rules

- Files here are never edited
- Files are referenced from notes via relative paths
- Naming : firstauthor_YYYY_short_title.pdf (e.g grossman_1980_efficient_markets.pdf)
