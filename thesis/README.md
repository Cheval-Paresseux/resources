# Thesis

This directory will contain the **actual thesis writing**.

Nothing here is authoritative yet — the source of truth is:
- `notes/` for content and structure
- `raw_sources/` for references

## Intended Structure (tentative)

- chapters/
- figures/
- tables/
- build/ (generated files, ignored by Git)

## Workflow Philosophy

- Chapters are assembled from existing notes
- No new ideas should originate here
- Every claim should trace back to:
  - a note in `notes/`
  - a source in `raw_sources/`
  - a reference in `bib/references.bib`

This directory is an output, not a workspace.
